      <p>
      One of the first steps of the track finding workflow is the creation of track seeds,
      i.e. compatible pairs of hits from different detector layers, that are subsequently
      fed to to higher level pattern recognition steps. However the set of compatible hit
      pairs is highly affected by combinatorial background resulting in the next steps of
      the tracking algorithm to process a significant fraction of fake doublets.
      <p>

      </p>
      The daset consist of a collection of pixel doublet seeds,  i.e. the hit pairs that could belong to
      the same particle. The compatibility between two hits is evaluated only on the basis of geometrical
      considerations, such as cuts in $\eta$, $\phi$ and $r$. These doublets define the building blocks for
      further tracks. Each doublet is charcaterised by a set of features, such as its coordinates and the charge
      released in ther Pixel detector, and the pixel cluster shape, projected on 2D histogram.
